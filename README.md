<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="src/screenshots/f1-screenshot10.png">

This app was inspired by various other Chrome new tab replacers that display aesthetic backgrounds. Additionally, I wanted to serve relevant info related to F1 races at a quick glance. The combination of those motivations resulted in a page that automatically displays the next upcoming race on the schedule. Race info is obtained via the Ergast Developer API. Features include:

- Countdown to upcoming races
- Several wallpaper quality backgrounds
- Track layout map
- Practice, qualifying, and race times adjusted to local time
- Historical records like the previous race winner and fastest lap time
- History bar to access all rounds of the season

### Built With

- React
- Tailwind
- Firebase

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Pertinent info is displayed at the center of the page. This includes the name of the race, name of the circuit, date, and (if applicable) countdown until the race date.

<br>

For the nearest upcoming race, within one week, the title will change accordingly.

<br>

For upcoming races, local schedule times will be displayed at the bottom left along with historical records like previous race winner and fastest lap times.

<img src="src/screenshots/f1-screenshot2.png" width="600">
<br>

For all races, the track layout map will be displayed at the bottom right. Here all turn numbers and DRS zones are shown.

<br>

To access other races like past races of the season, a history bar on the bottom center of the page allows access to all rounds. Currently displayed race is indicated by a red pill. The next upcoming race is indicated by a green pill when not displayed. At the end of the season, the race shuffle button will be selected by default.

<img src="src/screenshots/f1-screenshot9.png" width="600">
<br>

For past races, only the current race winner and fastest lap time will be shown.
